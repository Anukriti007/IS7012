            It’s with the aforementioned thought that I tread on the path of incessant learning and augmenting my skill set. Coalescing my technical prowess, analytical thinking and managerial skills, it’s only befitting that I elevate my level of expertise and pursue higher education.
            Having worked extensively in SAP/ERP and possessing a sound working knowledge of the latest software including C,  C++ , DBMS , ABAP , HANA , FIORI, etc I know the myriad of options and possibilities that Information Systems, as an industry, has to offer.
